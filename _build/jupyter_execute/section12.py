# ## The Chess Board

# Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid, where each square is labaled by its row(a-h) and column position (1-8). Each player begins with 16 pieces, either black or white, arranged at the top and bottom of the chessboard.

# In[3]:


board = fenBoard('8/8/8/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1')

# **Question:** Can you locate the inital position of each piece for white and black?
