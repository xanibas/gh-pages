# ## Setting up the Chess Board

# Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid consisting of eight vertical rows called files (*a-h*) and eight horizontal rows called ranks (*1-8*). Below you can see an example of an empty *chessboard*, the gameboard on which the chess pieces are placed.

# At the beginning of the game the queens are placed on the square of the same color.

board = fenBoard('8/8/8/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1')
display(displayBoard(board))


# **Question:** How do we arrange the chess pieces on the chessboard?
