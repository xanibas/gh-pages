# # How to Play Chess

# ***

# Chess, as we know it nowadays, was born out of the Indian game *Chaturanga* in the 7th century, and gradually spread to Asia and Persia. The game was inspired by battle, with chess pieces named according to the army divisions of the time. Once chess reached Europe in the 15th century, the pieces names were formalized to *pawn*, *knight*, *bishop*, *rook* and *queen* or *king* to reflect the composition of contemporary armies.
